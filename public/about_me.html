        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Im a man living in the Philippines and learning how to be a web developer.
            Been in the career of engineering and management, and I want to break through
            to the tech industry because I want to work with computers. Its not just in the 
            trend to work with computers, but the computers will be the future. Everything
            will be run by computers, and will be integrated with the old technology.
            And I believe that learning is for everyone!
